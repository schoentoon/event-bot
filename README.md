Event-Bot
=========

A Telegram event bot, giving people in a chat the option to simply vote with yes, maybe or no on an event and see everybody who will be at said event.
To get started make a copy of `config.example.yml` and change it accordingly and simply use the bundled docker-compose.yml to run it with docker-compose (`docker-compose up -d` is enough).
Or if you're not a fan of docker-compose just run the bot binary directly and point it at the config file.
